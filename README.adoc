== Description
This is the package that has been created for the RES-Q project. After the project started to grow up, we needed to generate feedbacks for the users automatical. This package is used to generate feedback in the form of presentations and excel sheets with calculated statistics. 

== Installation
Everything was tested with the **Python 3.6 and higher version**. 

.  Copy the folder `resqdb` downloaded from the repository into `site-packages` folder in your python installation. Because I'm using Anaconda, the path to my python packages is `D:Anaconda\Lib\site-packages`. 

. Install the following packages as well:
+
[source,python]
----
pip3 install pandas, numpy, xlsxwriter, pytz, scipy, psycopg2, python-pptx, statistics
----


. We've made also one modification of the `python-pptx` script. This modification will set that all labels are shown on the category axis. Without modification, only each second label is shown. 
+
[NOTE]
====
On Sept 9th, 2020 I found out that it is not necessary to modify the `python-pptx` package. But if you have the issue with labels, please follow the steps.
====
+
There are two options how to fix this:
+
* Copy the `resqdb\tmp\xmlwriter.py` into `python-pptx\chart` folder.
+
* Modify the file `python-pptx\chart\xmlwriter.py`. We will modify the setting for the classes `BarChartXmlWriter` and `LineChartXmlWriter`. Into the function `cat_ax_xml` add the line `'<c:tickLblSkip val="1"/>\n'` into `return` function. I always put it after the line `<c:tickLblPos val="nextTo"/>`.
+
I prefer the last option because there can be during months/years the updated in the python-pptx package and if we copy the old file we can break something or loose updates. 

== Usage
=== Connection.py
==== Get data 
[source,python]
----
from resqdb.Connection import Connection # <1>

c = Connection(nprocess=2) # <2>
c = Connection(nprocess=2, data='qasc') # <3>

dictdb_df = c.df # <4>

preprocessed_data = c.preprocessed_data # <5>
----
<1> Import Connection from the Connection module.
<2> Create Connection object. You can provide number of processed (`nprocess`) as argument but to be honest it doesn't work well. Or you can run it without argument and run it with 1 process. If create connection object without `data` argument the data from `resq_mix`, `ivttby_mix` and `thailand` are preprocessed. 
<3> This is example of the way how to provide argument to say which data you would like to obtain from the database. Another options is `atalaia` and `africa`. 
<4> The raw data can be accessed with property `df`. 
<5> The preprocessed data can be accessed with property `preprocessed_data`. I strongly recommend save this data as `csv` with `,` (comma) as a seperator.

=== Calculation.py
==== Filter data
This script uses the preprocessed data obtained from the Connection object or provided as argument. I provided examples of how to filter data by dates (<<filter_by_dates>>) or country (<<filter_by_country>>), but you can combine it and filter by country and dates in one run. Create object without any other arguments will filter data by DISCHARGE_DATE column. There are cases when the data has to be filtered by HOSPITAL_DATE or include all patients who have HOSPITAL_DATE or DISCHARGE_DATE in the date range. Both these options are mentioned in the following code (<<filter_by_dates>>).

[#filter_by_dates]
===== Filter data by date
The following code is example how to filter data for the date range. The date is filtered based on discharge dates. 

[source,python]
----
from resqdb.Calculation import FilterDataset # <1>
from datetime import datetime # <2>

date1 = datetime(2019, 3, 1) # <3>
date2 = datetime(2019, 3, 31) # <4>

fobj = FilterDataset(df=preprocessed_data, date1=date1, date2=date2) # <5>
fobj = FilterDataset(df=preprocessed_data, date1=date1, date2=date2, column="HOSPITAL_DATE") # <6>
fobj = FilterDataset(df=preprocessed_data, date1=date1, date2=date2, by_columns=True) # <7>

df = fobj.fdf # <8>
----
<1> Import FilterDataset from the Calculation module.
<2> Import datetime object from datetime module.
<3> Set first date that should be included in the dataset. 
<4> Set last date that should be included in the dataset. 
<5> Create new FilterDataset object where `df` are preprocessed data, `date1` and `date2` are ranges of the dates. 
<6> Create new FilterDataset object where the data will be filtered by hospital date. 
<7> Create new FilterDataset object where the data will be filtered by both columns, hospital date and discharge date. 
<8> The filtered result is stored in property called `fdf`. 

[#filter_by_country]
===== Filter data by country
The following code is example how to filter data by country. 

[source,python]
----
from resqdb.Calculation import FilterDataset # <1>
from datetime import datetime # <2>

fobj = FilterDataset(df=preprocessed_data, country='CZ') # <3>
df = fobj.fdf # <4>

----
<1> Import FilterDataset from the Calculation module.
<2> Import datetime object from datetime module.
<3> Create a new object FilterDataset with preprocessed data and country code as argument. 
<4> The filtered result is stored in property called `fdf`. 

==== Compute statistics
The class `ComputeStats` generate statistics from the preprocessed data. 

[source,python]
---- 
from resqdb.Calculation import ComputeStats # <1>

comp_df = ComputeStats(df=df, period=quarter_name, raw_data=raw_df) # <2>
comp_df = ComputeStats(df=df, period=quarter_name, raw_data=raw_df, comparison=True) # <3>

stats_df = comp_df._return_stats() # <4>
----
<1> Import `ComputeStats` from the resqdb package. 
<2> This is the example how to generate the statistics for all sites in one file, eg. for Angels Awards, etc. Arguments: `df` - the preprocessed/filtered data, `period` - the name of the period, `raw_data` - the preprocessed data.
<3> This is the example how to generate the statistics per countries. Arguments: `df` - the preprocessed/filtered data, `period` - the name of the period, `raw_data` - the preprocessed data and `comparison` - True if you want to compare countries and not sites.
<4> Obtainer calculated statistics from the object. 

=== FormatData.py
The following classes generate the formatted excel file with the data. 

==== Generate preprocessed data
The following example will generate the preprocessed data as excel file. 

[source,python]
----
from resqdb.FormatData import GeneratePreprocessedData # <1>

GeneratePreprocessedData(df=df, report=report_type, quarter=quarter_name, csv=True) # <2>
----
<1> Import `GeneratePreprocessedData` from the resqdb package. 
<2> Create new object that will generate prerpocessed data. You have to provide a few arguments, `df` - the preprocessed/filtered data, `report` -> the report type, `quarter` -> the quarter name and `csv` -> True if data were loaded from csv file as false. The file with the similar filename `quarter_Q1_2020_preprocessed_data.xlsx` is generated. 

==== Generate formatted angels awards
The following example will generate the formatted angels awards results. 

[source,python]

GenerateFormattedStats(df=stats_df, country_code='CZ', quarter='Q1_2020', report='quarter', country_name='Czech Republic') # <3>
GenerateFormattedStats(df=stats_df, country=True, country_code='CZ', split_sites=True, quarter='Q1_2020', report='quarter', country_name='Czech Republic') # <4>

----
<1> Import `GenerateFormattedStats` from the `resqdb` package. 
<2> Create new object that will generate formatted statistics with all data and as a result it will generate the file with name 'quarter_Q1_2020.xlsx' (<<quarter_Q1_2020>>). Arguments: `df` - the calculated statistics for all countries or can be filtered, `report` - the report type, `quarter` - the name of quarter. 
<3> This line of code will generated formatted statistics for the country with the filename such as  'quarter_CZ_Q1_2020.xlsx' (<<quarter_CZ_Q1_2020>>). Arguments: `df` - the calculated statistics including data just for CZ, `report` - the report type, `quarter` - the name of quarter, `country_code` - the code of country and `country_name` - the name of country.
<4> This line of the code will generate the formatted statistics for each site in the data with the filename such as  'quarter_CZ_001_Q1_2020.xlsx'. Arguments: `df` - the calculated statistics including data just for CZ, `country` - include country as site in report, `report` - the report type, `quarter` - the name of quarter, `country_code` - the code of country, `country_name` - the name of country and `split_sites` - generate reports per site. If you provide calculated statistics where are overall results for country, country will be included in the report as a site.

=== AfricaReport.py
This class has been creatd to generate reports for the South Africa. As a results, reports similar to general reports are generated. The only change is, that South Africa requested just a few variables to be calculated. 

There are three types of reports to be generated for South Africa. 

* **COUNTRY REPORT** (<<ch_country_report>>) -> this reports contains overall results for the South Africa and results per sites. 
* **REGION REPORT** (<<ch_region_report>>) -> this report contains overall results for the South Africa and results per countries. 
* **SITE REPORT** (<<ch_site_report>>) -> this report contains overall results for South Africa, overall results for region and results for site.
